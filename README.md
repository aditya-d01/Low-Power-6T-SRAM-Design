# Low-Power 6T SRAM Cell Design (180nm | 90nm | 45nm)

This project involves the design and analysis of a low-power 6T SRAM cell using Cadence tools across three technology nodes: 180 nm, 90 nm, and 45 nm.
Includes circuit design, DC and transient simulations, testbench creation, layout with DRC/LVS checks, parasitic extraction, and performance comparison across nodes.

# Project Workflow

1. Schematic design of 6T SRAM cell

2. Symbol creation & testbench setup

3. DC analysis (noise margin, stability)

4. Transient analysis (read/write operations)

5. Full layout design (Cadence Virtuoso)

6. DRC & LVS verification

7. Parasitic extraction

8. Performance comparison across nodes
